All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.6] - 1 April 2026

### Added

- **Debian/Ubuntu packaging**: `.deb` package built automatically and attached to GitHub releases.
- **Launchpad PPA**: `ppa:loteran/arctis-sound-manager` for easy `apt install` on Ubuntu 24.04+.
- **PPA upload workflow**: GitHub Actions automatically uploads source packages to PPA on each release.

## [1.0.4] - 29 March 2026

### Added

- **External output volume**: HDMI/sound card volume card on home page with auto-detection of non-SteelSeries sinks.
- **Stream routing to output**: "O" button on app tags routes streams through the output EQ node.
- **Sonar Output EQ**: new Equalizer tab with 8ch 7.1 parametric EQ for external output (no HeSuVi surround).
- **Configurable output device**: Settings dropdown to select external output sink.
- **Update notification**: banner on home page when a newer release is available (checks GitHub once/day).
- **Clean exit**: Exit from systray stops all ASM services and restarts pipewire.

### Fixed

- **Output EQ not applying**: filter-chain capture node used `Audio/Sink/Internal`; changed to `Audio/Sink` for the output channel.
- **Audio loss on preset apply**: output channel now only restarts `filter-chain` instead of full pipewire stack.
- **Apps invisible after routing to output**: streams routed through EQ now appear on the Output card.
- **Settings layout**: fixed label widths, toggle alignment, dropdown sizing.

## [1.0.1] - 29 March 2026

### Fixed

- **ANC/Transparent mode stuck**: device init sequence hardcoded ANC off, preventing GUI toggle when settings had a different saved value. Init now uses `settings.noise_cancelling` / `settings.transparent_level` references.
